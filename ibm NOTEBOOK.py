# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# %% [markdown]
# In this notebook, we summarize some of the most important tools, languages, and libraries in the field of Data Science.  
# We will also perform some simple arithmetic operations using R code.

# %% [markdown]
# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# - Python  
# - R  
# - SQL  
# - Julia  
# - Scala

# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# %%
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3 * 4) + 5

# %%
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
200 / 60
